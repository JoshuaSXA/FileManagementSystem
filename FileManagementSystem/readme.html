        <div class="format-system-text">
            <p>
                In the simulator page, there is a button entitled as 'Format' in the touch bar.
                If you click this button, then the file-management-system will be formatted. This also indicates that all your file data will be lost.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1 style="font-size: 22px;">2.&nbspCreate Folder</h1>
        <div class="format-system-text">
            <p>
                In the simulator page, there is a button entitled as 'New Folder' in the touch bar.
                If you click this button, then a new window will be displayed.
                This window mainly contains a input label where you can input filename.
                If the filename you input is rational and correct,
                (This means the filename shouldn't be null or contain any special character.)
                a new folder will be created and displayed in the page after you click the 'Confirm' button.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1 style="font-size: 22px;">3.&nbspCreate File</h1>
        <div class="format-system-text">
            <p>
                In the simulator page, there is a button entitled as 'New File' in the touch bar.
                If you click this button, then a new window will be displayed.
                The subsequent steps are the same as that in part two.
                The only difference is that you will get a text file if the file is created successfully.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1 style="font-size: 22px;">4.&nbspDelete File</h1>

                It's very easy if you wanna remove a folder or file from your file system.
                There are only two steps you should follow:
                1.&nbspMove your mouse right over the folder or file icon, and right-click the icon.
                2.&nbspSelect the option 'Delete', and click it.
                As you can see, the target file will be removed from your file system only if there isn't any system error.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1 style="font-size: 22px;">5.&nbspDisplay File Contents</h1>
        <div class="format-system-text">
            <p>
                There are two ways to open and display the folder or text file contents.
                First, you can double-click the target file, then the file will be opened.
                Second, you can also get the file content showed by right-clicking the file icon.
                Because of different file type, the content of folder and text file is totally different.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1 style="font-size: 22px;">6.&nbspChange File Directory</h1>
        <div class="format-system-text">
            <img src="img/shortcut-2.png" style="width: 700px; height:433px;"/>
            <p>
                You should use the "Cut" and "Paste" function to realize file directory modification.
                First, you are supposed to cut the target file. The system will save the file into the clipboard.
                Second,  int the target file directory, you should paste the file.
                Not surprisingly, the target file directory structure has been changed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1 style="font-size: 22px;">7.&nbspReturn to Previous Directory</h1>
        <div class="format-system-text">
            <img src="img/shortcut-3.png" style="width: 700px; height:53px;"/>
            <p>
                You can click the return button to come back to last file directory.
            </p>

        <div class="format-system-text">
            <img src="img/shortcut-4.png" style="width: 700px; height:433px;"/>
            <p>
                To begin with, you should open a text file and click the blank editable area.
                In edit mode, you can input any text as you want, but the number of characters in your text should be limited no more than 1024.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1 style="font-size: 22px;">9.&nbspSave File</h1>

                Every time you finish yout text editing, you are advised to click this button before exiting or your text data would be lost.
